STAGE 2 (With 0 backend dependancy):

-Chainlink Automation runs and stores tweetIds on chain
-Chainlink Function only calls Twitter API and calculates the mint




MINT CALCULATION (Needs to ran weekly because twitter api is weekly)

Functions need to all return the same value, what happens if someone likes/retweets something while we mint?
How do we register referrals on-chain?

1) Create a referral tree
2) Code an algorithm that given a referal tree, outputs an array of array that represents the steps on that can go in parallel (first array should be all the leaves) in the order we should mint linearly
